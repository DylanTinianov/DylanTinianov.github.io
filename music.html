        Intro:  Fight it off,
                fight it off.
                We'll fight it off.

        Verse1: Everybody seems blue all the time.
                Everybody's got something to fight for.
                But imagine what this world could be,
                if everyone just lived in peave.
                Could we get over all our crime?

        Chorus: Everybody's got something to live for.
                Every mother's got a child on her mind.
                Everyboy's got the whole world to care for.
                We'll fight it off, fight it off.

                We'll fight it off.

                            Fill

        Verse2: Everybody's got something to hide.
                Everybody keeps hiding in their lies.
                But imagine what we could do,
                as a people if we nurtured and grew.
                Could we get over all our pride?

        Chorus: Everybody's got something to live for.
                Every mother's got a child on her mind.
                Everyboy's got the whole world to care for.
                We'll fight it off, fight it off.

                Every lover's got someone to love to.
                Every teacher's got a student to hold with pride
                Everyboy's got the whole world to care for.
                We'll fight it off, fight it off.

                We'll fight it off.
                We'll keep on fighting it off.
                We'll fight it off, fight it off.
                We'll fight it off, fight it off

        Bridge: We'll fight it off, fight it off.
                We'll fight it off.
                We'll fight it off, yeah we'll fight it off
                We'll fight it off.
